# Colorizer

> **Permission required:** These commands require the Admin role!

This command lets you add color to your name! The way Ares works, it can't accept a
name that includes ansi tags with the `rename me=<new name>` command (help name). This
bypasses this restriction so Staff can have color in their name.

`colorizer` - Clears your colorized name.
`colorizer/set <colorized name>/<uncolorized name>` - Sets your colorized name.

> **Note:** Your <uncolorized name> should be your name as it would appear without ansi tags.
This is how Ares will find you if someone targets you with a command looking for your name.

>For example: `colorizer/set %xbOnnotangu%xn/Onnotangu`
