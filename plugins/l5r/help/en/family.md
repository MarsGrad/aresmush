#L5R Families

Samurai and Clan Ronin characters belong to one of the many families
that make up the Clans. Available families can be listed with the following:

`families` - Lists all available families
`families/sort <clan>` - Lists the families for a particular Clan
`family <family name>` - Displays more detail about a given family

>**Tip!** You can cycle through the various pages with `families2`, `families3`, etc.
The same applies to families/sort. (`families2/sort`, `families3/sort`)

Once you've decided on a family, you can set it with:

`family/set <family name>` - Sets your family to the given family name

To remove a family you set accidentally:

`family/rem` - Removes your family.

>**Note:** If you wish to play a True Ronin, simply set your family to none by
doing: `family/set none`.
