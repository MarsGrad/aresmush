# Managing L5R Abilities

In v1.0 of the L5R system, the management of character abilities (techniques, spells, etc.)
is handled by the Admin. The following commands allow staff to add and remove these abilities
from character sheets.

`tech/add <character>=<technique>` - Adds a technique to a character's sheet
`tech/rem <character>=<technique>` - Removes a technique from a character's sheet

`spell/add <character>=<spell>` - Adds a spell to a character's sheet
`spell/rem <character>=<spell>` - Removes a spell from a character's sheet

`kata/add <character>=<kata>` - Adds a kata technique to a character's sheet
`kata/rem <character>=<kata>` - Removes a kata technique from a character's sheet

`kiho/add <character>=<kiho>` - Adds a kiho technique to a character's sheet
`kiho/rem <character>=<kiho>` - Removes a kiho technique from a character's sheet

>**Note:** As of v1.0, the system will *NOT* check if a character qualifies for a given ability.
Use the commands detailed in [Abilities](help/abilities) to check prereqs.
