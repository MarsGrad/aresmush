   By agreeing to these terms of service, you pledge to read and adhere to the rules
and policies laid out in the 'policy' command. Measures will be taken to deal with
those players who do not follow these rules. Above all, treat everyone with respect.

   *WARNING* -- Rokugan is a dangerous place full of violence and death. The samurai
of Rokugan acknowledge this fact every time they take up their swords, and most are
never seen without them. It is a bloody life, but one of beauty as well. By accepting
these terms of service, you are also accepting that your character will most likely die.
We will do our utmost to ensure that every death has some measure of meaning and gravitas.
We encourage our players to do the same for each other.
